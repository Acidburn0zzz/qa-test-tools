- Find a good way to put the output of progressive_critic_ok into a scalar variable (without using a IPC::Cmd).
- Reintroduce the verbose mode
- Working on a most adapted common structure to return (and to display). List::Compare will be too light.
- Improve the Qoha namespace
- Add new tests :)

FIXES:
- If a file is deleted, we don't want to launch tests on it !
